Roughly check Solar electric production vs expected output

I used to have a script that ran on my system daily and would send me alerts if something was wrong. I would like to re-do it and share it, but haven't decided exactly how I want it to work so I haven't really started yet.

The basic idea is that you check the weather for the amount of cloud cover for the day and the number of daylight hours and get a rough projection of solar production. If something is wrong it could send an email/text. It could also be integrated into an Alexa voice skill so you can ask how the solar is doing and it would let you know.
